# Basic Expense Tracker (TypeScript)

This is a basic expense tracker built with TypeScript. It is a simple app that allows you to add, edit and remove expenses.
This app will also allow you to filter expenses by category.

## Purpose of this project
This app is definitely nothing fancy! The purpose of this project was to brush up on my TypeScript skills and get myself familiar with
React and React Hooks again.
